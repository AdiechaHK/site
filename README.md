## What, Why?

Vue is the approachable, versatile and performant progressive javascript framework.

What we would like to bring with this meetup:

  - More members of the Bangalore Dev community to participate in open source projects, specially connected with Vue.
  - Create a iterative feedback cycle, letting members share their experiences and ideas with Vue.
  - Have special training events, so everyone gets up to speed with the technology.
