      <p>
        Atomic design is an evolutionary approach of breaking down interfaces into fundamental building blocks and build the system bottom-up. It helps us to build consistent, solid and reusable design systems. This has gained a lot of strength and popularity in recent days.

      <p>
        The Single File Component structure of Vue makes this approach a powerful ally for developers. Let me demonstrate how the union of the autonomous components of Vue works perfectly with Atomic Design.
